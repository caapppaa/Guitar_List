This is just a simple list application made by myself for a course. 
This was created with React Native, it uses Expo and is optimised for IOS but can also run on Android. 

To RUN: 
- Simply clone the repository
- Open NPM Scripts
- Click Start
- Type I for Ios or A for Android into the console (Depending on platform and dev tools)
